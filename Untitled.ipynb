Drew walks by me Can't he tell that I can't breathe? And there he goes, so perfectly The kind of flawless I wish I could be She'd better hold him tight, give him all her love Look in those beautiful eyes and know she's lucky 'cause He's the reason for the teardrops on my guitar The only thing that keeps me wishing on a wishing star He's the song in the car I keep singing, don't know why I do... So I drive home alone, as I turn off the light I'll put his picture down and maybe get some sleep tonight He's the reason for the teardrops on my guitar The only one who's got enough of me to break my heart He's the song in the car I keep singing, don't know why I do... He's the time taken up, but there's never enough And he's all that I need to fall into Drew looks at me I fake a smile so he won't see   \n",

You two are dancing in the snowglobe round and round And he keeps a picture of you in his office downtown And you understand now why they lost their minds and fought the wars And why I spent my whole life trying to put it into words 'Cause you can hear it in the silence You can feel it on the way home You can see it with the lights out You are in love, true love You are in love!

You two are dancing in the snowglobe round and round And he keeps a picture of you in his office downtown And you understand now why they lost their minds and fought the wars And why I spent my whole life trying to put it into words 'Cause you can hear it in the silence You can feel it on the way home You can see it with the lights out You are in love, true love You are in love! You can hear it in the silence, silence, you You can feel it on the way home, way home, you You can see it with the lights out, lights out You are in love, true love You are in love You can hear it in the silence, silence, you You can feel it on the way home, way home, you You can see it with the lights out, lights out You are in love, true love You are in love   \n",
